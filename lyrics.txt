Oh goodbye Tuesday train
I'm looking for a milestone
But it doesn't seem to be one on this path
It's far from what I want

Oh goodbye Wednesday train
I'm looking for the merit of mine
But it does not seem to be one on this path.
It's far from what I want.

Where can I find you?
The train has already gone
Not a big deal No need to rush
Let's go by the Thursday train

Oh goodbye Friday train
I'm looking for decent deal
But it seems that there are none on this path
It's far from what I want

Oh goodbye Saturday train
I'm looking for an appropriate time
But it seems that there are none on this path
It's far from what I want

Where can I find you?
The train has already gone
Not a big deal No need to rush
Let's go by the Sunday train

I just noticed now,
I didn't have
a ticket to the future

But I found it now,
It was nothing hard
All I wanted was an excuse

Oh now I found you
The train can-be either or not

Oh we can go anywhere
There's nothing left here to do
It's just perfect No need to rush.
Let's go by the Birthday train
